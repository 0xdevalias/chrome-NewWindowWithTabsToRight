# chrome-NewWindowWithTabsToRight

This extension creates a new window with the tabs to the right of the currently selected tab.

### Why?

* I may be somewhat of a tab junkie.. I like my tabs, ok!!
* Recently started using [Sesh](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/sesh/emclpejnhkiogdlimfgipbdfpdcnhhoj?hl=en) ([GitHub](https://github.com/yujily/sesh)) by [Yuji Kosugi](https://github.com/yujiberra) ([Twitter](https://twitter.com/yujiberra)) to stash away my various workspaces of tabs till a later date when they actually become relevant again.
* In the heat of the tab filled moment, sometimes I forget to make a new window first, and thus ~~am~~ was left with the arduous task of manually dragging them into a new window.
* Not anymore!!
